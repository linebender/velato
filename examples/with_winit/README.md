# Usage

Running the viewer without any arguments will render a built-in set of Lottie images:

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit --release
```

Optionally, you can pass in paths to Lottie files that you want to render:

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit --release -- [LOTTIE FILES]
```

## Controls

- Mouse drag-and-drop will translate the image.
- Mouse scroll wheel will zoom.
- Arrow keys switch between Lottie images in the current set.
- Space resets the position and zoom of the image.
- S toggles the frame statistics layer
- C resets the min/max frame time tracked by statistics
- D toggles displaying the required number of each kind of dynamically allocated element (default: off)
- V toggles VSync on/off (default: on)
- Escape exits the program.
